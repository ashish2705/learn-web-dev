	<h2>Killing of pregnant elephant in Kerala 
	triggers nationwide outrage</h2>
	<article id="info"><span>PALAKKAD:</span> The killing of a pregnant wild elephant has triggered a nationwide outrage even as Kerala chief minister promised strict action against the offenders. “The forest department is probing the case and the culprits won't be spared,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.<iframe id="vid" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ymGK3LnxRko" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></article>

	<article>Mannarkkad forest division registered a case and initiated a probe into killing of the 15-year-old cow elephant. Two organizations announced cash reward to anyone providing information that would lead to the arrest of the offenders.
	The elephant had chewed on an explosive-stuffed pineapple that went off in its mouth. The injured animal stood in Velliyar River, where it died on May 27 at Thiruvizhamkunnu forest section in Kottopadam grama panchayat. The forest department had employed two kumki elephants to 	rescue the injured animal. The efforts went in vain.</article>

	<article>According to Mannarkkad divisional forest officer (DFO) Sunil Kumar, the elephant might have come from Silent Valley National
	Park’s buffer zone. It died on a private land 300m from Thiruvizhamkunnu forest section. “We have registered a case for killing the wild elephant but nobody has been arrested. We are waiting for the postmortem report to find out the exact cause of its death,” he said. The officer said the firecracker-filled fruit could have been placed to kill crop-raiding wild animals.</article>

	<article>The elephant’s tragic end became public after a forest official, Mohan Krishnan, tendered an emotional apology on his Facebook page. “Sorry sister,” Krishnan, who witnessed the elephant's death, posted on Facebook. “With her mouth and tongue destroyed in the explosion, she paced around hungry without being able to eat. She must have been more worried about the health of the child inside her than about her own hunger."</article>
