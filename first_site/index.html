	<article id="basic">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[4][6] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March.[7][8] As of 4 June 2020, more than 6.54 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 386,000 deaths; more than 2.83 million people have recovered.[5]</article>

	<article id="prevention">Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[418][419] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[420][421] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.</article>

	<h2>Killing of pregnant elephant in Kerala triggers nationwide outrage</h2>
	<article>PALAKKAD: The killing of a pregnant wild elephant has triggered a nationwide outrage even as Kerala chief minister promised strict action against the offenders. “The forest department is probing the case and the culprits won't be spared,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.</article>
	<article>Mannarkkad forest division registered a case and initiated a probe into killing of the 15-year-old cow elephant. Two organizations announced cash reward to anyone providing information that would lead to the arrest of the offenders.
	The elephant had chewed on an explosive-stuffed pineapple that went off in its mouth. The injured animal stood in Velliyar River, where it died on May 27 at Thiruvizhamkunnu forest section in Kottopadam grama panchayat. The forest department had employed two kumki elephants to 	rescue the injured animal. The efforts went in vain.</article>
	<article>According to Mannarkkad divisional forest officer (DFO) Sunil Kumar, the elephant might have come from Silent Valley National
	Park’s buffer zone. It died on a private land 300m from Thiruvizhamkunnu forest section. “We have registered a case for killing the wild elephant but nobody has been arrested. We are waiting for the postmortem report to find out the exact cause of its death,” he said. The officer said the firecracker-filled fruit could have been placed to kill crop-raiding wild animals.</article>

	<f2>Wildlife warden of Silent Valley National Park Samuel V Pachuau said that patrolling has been intensified after the elephant’s death.</f2>
